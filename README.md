# neural Networks e Deep Learning

Besides Portugal, on most of the countries where the portuguese language is spoken economic hardship is common between it's citizens. Therefore, the access to content that are not in their native language is limited, given that english classes are rather expensive in these countries.

Having this in mind, this project was created with the objective of making the book [neural networks and deep learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by [Michael Nielsen](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen) easily accessible for portuguese speakers by translating it.
