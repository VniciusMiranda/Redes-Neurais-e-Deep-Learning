# Redes Neurais e Deep Learning

Besides portugal, the portuguese language is spoken in countries where the access to english classes is limited by economic differences, so they are limited with the knowledge available on the portuguese language.

Therefore, this project was created with the objective to contribue with the accessibility of knowledge, in the area of neural networks and deep learning, 
for the people that live on these countries, by translating the excelent book [neural networks and deep learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by [Michael Nielsen](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen) to the portuguese language.
